This is a way of speaking to your computer and having it speak back to you. I'm
currently only running this on my Mac (Snow Leopard), and it doesn't work on
other OSes without going in and changing the code. Mac-specific stuff is
documented below. TBH, this whole repository should probably just be ignored.

It has a whole bunch of dependencies that you need to install:
- XCode (gcc, etc) off your OSX install disk
- macports (requires gcc, etc)
- py26-gobject from macports
- py-gobject from macports (perhaps one of these two is redundant?)
- gst-plugins-good from macports
- py-beautifulsoup4 from macports
- pyttsx by running the following command:
    sudo easy_install pyttsx
- cssselect by running the following command:
    sudo easy_install cssselect
- readability (requires cssselect) by running the following command:
    sudo easy_install readability-lxml
  (note: Ubuntu users will first need to install the python-dev package for this
  to work)
- sphinxbase from source code from CMU and sourceforge
- pocketsphinx (requires sphinxbase) from source code from CMU and sourceforge
  NOTE: if you are running Ubuntu, the most recent version of pocketsphinx in
  Synaptic is 0.4.1, which was released in 2007. I kept getting segfaults from
  this version when trying to parse finite state grammmars, so I instead
  compiled and installed pocketsphinx and sphinxbase from source (version
  0.8). To do this, I needed to install the Synaptic package
  libgstreamer0.10-dev, because otherwise running ./configure before making
  the sphinx libraries would decide that gstreamer was not installed and would
  skip compiling/installing those pieces.

Now, configure a few things:
- in your .zshrc, set PYTHONPATH to include the place where gobject is:
    export PYTHONPATH=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages
- run the following two commands to load some stuff for gstreamer:
    sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist
    sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist
- Go to the computerbox directory and edit configuration.py.
- Go to the cron_jobs/ directory and edit configuration.py there as well.
- Run the following command so that git ignores modifications in
  configuration.py files:
    git update-index --assume-unchanged */configuration.py
- Go to the cron_jobs/ directory and add the .plist files to launchd:
    launchctl load news_cron.plist
    launchctl load remove_old_news.plist

Here are (some of) the Mac-specific parts that need to be changed for non-Macs:
- Much of the installation and configuration described above is probably
  different.
- In particular, adding cron-like jobs on other systems probably doesn't use
  launchd and plists, so you're on your own setting up the stuff in the
  cron_jobs directory.
- In computerbox/speaker.py, near the bottom, change the way Acknowledge is
  defined. There are two definitions of it (one setting it to _MacAcknowledge
  and one setting it to _TtsAcknowledge); comment one out and uncomment the
  other.
- Using launchd and the .plist files in the cron_jobs/ directory is
  Mac-specific; you'll want to run those as cron jobs instead. Look at the
  README in that directory FMI.

If you want to adapt the pocketsphinx acoustic model to your location (i.e.,
teach it to ignore your air conditioner and learn your accent better and stuff),
Ubuntu users will need to install the sox package, compile the sphinxtrain code
from CMU's sourceforge page, and follow the instructions at
http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/tutorialadapt
