This is a way of speaking to your computer and having it speak back to you. I'm
currently only running this on my Mac (Snow Leopard), and it doesn't work on
other OSes without going in and changing the code. Mac-specific stuff is
documented below. TBH, this whole repository should probably just be ignored.

It has a whole bunch of dependencies that you need to install:
 - XCode (gcc, etc) off your OSX install disk
 - macports (requires gcc, etc)
 - py26-gobject from macports
 - py-gobject from macports (perhaps one of these two is redundant?)
 - gst-plugins-good from macports
 - pyttsx by running the following command:
     easy_install http://pypi.python.org/packages/any/p/pyttsx/pyttsx-1.0.egg#md5=4a7153e16b2360172286805466ee117d
 - sphinxbase (from source code from CMU and sourceforge)
 - pocketsphinx (from source code from CMU and sourceforge)

Now, configure a few things:
 - in your .zshrc, set PYTHONPATH to include the place where gobject is:
     export PYTHONPATH=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages
 - run the following two commands to load some stuff for gstreamer:
    sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist
    sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist
 - Go to the computerbox directory and edit configuration.py.

You'll also want to make the news- and weather-updaters into cron jobs:

Here are (some of) the Mac-specific parts that need to be changed for non-Macs:
 - In computerbox/speaker.py, near the bottom, change the way Acknowledge is
   defined. There are two definitions of it (one setting it to _MacAcknowledge
   and one setting it to _TtsAcknowledge); comment one out and uncomment the
   other.
