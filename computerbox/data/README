This directory contains data for the PocketSphinx speech recognition system.
Files should come in pairs: a .dic file containing a pronunciation dictionary
and a .fsg file containing a finite state grammar.

If you haven't done so already, edit ../configuration.py and add the location of
this directory as DATA_DIR!

The .dic files are mappings from words to sequences of phonemes to pronounce
them. They support multiple pronunciations of the same word by putting (n) after
the word (where n is a number). As an example, see test.dic.

The .fsg files are the finite state grammars (read: finite state machines) that
describe what words might be spoken in what order. They're generated by the
Python files in ../gen/.  Compare, for example, test.fsg to the output of
../gen/test_gen.py
